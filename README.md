# Embedded Systems Projects

A collection of embedded system projects based on the Arduino microcontroller. Each one has its own readme file which explains in detail what the project is about.

## Getting Started

Pick on any of the individual projects in this repository and you will find detailed instructions about how to go about setting them up. These are meant for hobbyists or school students looking for an interesting project to carry out. They can easily be implemented at an affordable cost.

These projects use the [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) microcontroller in either the Uno variant, or the Mega. There's not much difference between them save for the more I/O ports available on the Mega, which expands on the number of devices and sensors you can connect to the controller. The components can easily be obtained from Amazon or eBay. A beginner's kit is recommended for getting started, as it comes with a variety of components you can use to familiarise yourself with this microcontroller, as well as build a variety of projects with it.

## References

The internet is the greatest source of information if you know where to look. Having said that, some useful sites for references include, but are not limited to:

* [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) - The official website for the microcontroller used here offers a lot of great tuorials to help you get started, as well as interesting articles and updates to what's going on in the Arduino maker space
* [SparkFun](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/what-is-an-arduino) - They make a lot of sensors and components for the Arduino, and also have tutorials on how to use these components in your projects.
* [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/category/17) - Another component maker, they offer guides and tutorials on the Arduino much like SparkFun does
