# Home Security System with Arduino

This is a simple home security project that uses an Arduino as the central control unit. It also utilizes a servo motor as a lock for a door, a GSM module to contact the home owner when there's an intruder, or a fire in the home, a RTD to detect high temperatures in the event of a fire, an LED as a blinking light when the alarm goes off, as well as a buzzer, to make for an audibe alarm system.
